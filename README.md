C.E.L.T. is a versatile tool that can perform sentiment analysis on different types of data, including text, audio, reviews, and news articles. Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest-growing research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. In our project, we aim to achieve our goal of accurately predicting a user's sentiment by analyzing the data provided using different types of input data.

## Introduction

### What is Sentimental Analysis?
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone in a piece of text, audio, or other forms of data. It involves identifying whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Why is it important?
<ul>
  <li>Sentiment analysis can help businesses and organizations understand how their customers or users feel about their products, services, or experiences. </li>
  <li>Companies can gauge public opinion about their products or services, track trends, and identify emerging issues or opportunities in the market.</li>
  <li>News agencies and media companies use sentiment analysis to analyze public sentiment towards news articles or events. This helps in generating content that aligns with the interests of the audience.</li>
  <li>Sentiment analysis is used in politics to understand public sentiment towards political candidates, parties, or policies. It is also used to gauge public opinion on social issues.</li>
</ul>

### Why use C.E.L.T.?

C.E.L.T. provides the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>Comprehensive Insights: </b>Different types of data sources provide diverse perspectives. An all-encompassing tool can provide a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment.</li>
  <li><b>Multichannel Data Analysis:</b> In today's world, opinions and sentiments are expressed across various channels, including social media, customer reviews, audio recordings, and news articles. A tool that can analyze these diverse data sources offers a more accurate picture of public sentiment.</li>
  <li><b>Cost-Efficiency:</b> Instead of using multiple specialized tools, a single tool that can handle multiple data types is cost-effective and streamlines the analysis process.</li>
</ul>

Although HTML and CSS are used for the front end, the users can merge the backend logic with any of the front end frameworks they wish to use such as React, and AngularJS.
