Implemented an algorithm for User ID automation in Python which required mapping between the user and the port assigned to. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Created a Web based Application with User Interface. The users upload their family members as objects onto the website. On a broad
 
 
scale with abundant data, the application will find out whether members are connected using tree search methods. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Pokemon​ ​Battle - Python(Socket Programming) 

 

A pokemon game implemented using socket programming with two trainers able to battle out each other by selecting pokemons from
 
the given roster. The game's implementation is in the initial stage with the backend logic being coded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Database Management Systems - JAVA, MySQLand JDBC

 

 

 

 

 

Designed a database for an online library system to make book transactions and receive orders from distributors. The application level
 
programming was written in JAVA while MySQL was used to perform queries on the database internally. 

● Arrhythmia Classifier - Python, KNN K FoldCV, Random Forests  
 

Developed a K Fold Cross Validation KNN algorithm from scratch to classify the arrhythmia dataset using major attributes. This was
 
 
part of the course project and the algorithm obtained an efficiency of 68% in classifying the right data points. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● United States Path Routing - Python

 
 

 

 

 

 

A Depth First Search, A* and Recursive Best First Search algorithms were implemented to find the best path between a source and a
   
destination in a map dataset provided by the instructor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Data Analytics - Python
 

 

 

Developed an AI model based on Bloom’s Taxonomy that was capable of converting a prolonged lecture video to a short summary
 
 
video. A user defined word set was initially defined and data analysis was performed using NLP and Google API’s. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Security and Robotics  - C, Embedded C, Python and MySQL(Socket Programming) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The project was developed to have multiple robots perform serial verification and authentication of users while being autonomous.
 
This was intended to be a prototype to a larger scale project. The project was recommended for copyrights.
