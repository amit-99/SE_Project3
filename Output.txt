Course Project Guidelines

Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting data mining problem of your
choice in the context of a real-world data set. Below, you will ﬁnd some project ideas, but the best
idea would be to combine data mining algorithms with problems in your own research interest.
Your class project must be about new things you have done this semester; you can’t use results you
have developed in previous semesters or in other classes.

Projects can be done in teams of three to four students or individually. For a four-person
group, group members are responsible for dividing up the work equally and making sure that each
member contributes. For each project, the TAs will be your a project consultant/mentor. The ﬁnal
responsibility to deﬁne and execute an interesting piece of work is yours. You are strongly urged
to consult the TAs or the instructor early on if your project will rely purely on simulated data or if
you intend to do a learning theory-related project.

Your project will be worth 33% of your ﬁnal class grade, and will have 4 deliverable:
• Proposal, Due Date: Sept 13th at 11:45PM: 1 page (1%)
• Midterm Report, Due Date: Oct 18th at 11:45 PM: 4-5 pages (2%)
• Project Presentation Slides (Date: Nov 26th at 11:45PM)
• Project Presentation (Date: Nov 27- Dec 4th Class Time)(10%)
• Project Final Report (Date: Dec 5th at 11:45PM): 8 pages (20%)
Note that all write-ups in the form of a NIPS paper: (Link here to the latex template). If you
are not familiar with latex, please get familiar with it because the latex format is becoming the only
template accepted by many conferences. The page limits are strict! Papers over the limit will not
be considered. Each deliverable of your project will be evaluated based on several factors:

• The novelty of the project ideas and applications. The groups are encouraged to come up
with original ideas and novel applications for the projects. A project with new ideas (algo-
rithms, methods, theory) on data mining or new, interesting applications of existing algo-
rithms is scored higher than a project without many new ideas/applications.

• The extensiveness of the study and experiments. A project that produces a more intelli-
gent system by combining several ML techniques together, a project that involves extensive
experiments and thorough analysis of the experimental results, or a project that nicely incor-
porates various real-world applications, are scored higher.

• The writing style and the clarity of the written paper.

Project Proposal (Due Date: Sept 13th.)

A list of suggested projects and data sets is posted below. Read the list carefully. You are encour-
aged to use one of the suggested data sets because we know that they have been successfully used
for data mining and machine learning in the past. If you prefer to use a different data set, we will
consider your proposal, but you must have access to this data already, and present a clear proposal
for what you would do with it.

Page limit: Proposals should be one page maximum.
Suggest to include the following information:
• Project title
• Data set
• Project idea. This should be approximately two paragraphs.
• Software you will need to write.
• Papers to read. Include 1-3 relevant papers. You will probably want to read at least one of

them before submitting your proposal

• Teammate (if any) and work division. We expect projects done in a group to be more sub-

stantial than projects done individually.

• Midterm milestone: What will you complete by the Midway report? Experimental results of

some kind are expected here.

Midway Report (Due Date: Oct 18th)

This should be a 4-5 page short report in the form of a NIPS paper, and it serves as a checkpoint.
It should consist of the same sections as your ﬁnal report (background, method, experiment, con-
clusion, and references), with a few sections ‘under construction’. Speciﬁcally, the introduction
and related work sections should be in their almost ﬁnal form; the section on the proposed method
should be almost ﬁnished; the sections on the experiments and conclusions will have whatever
results you have obtained, as well as ‘place-holders’ for the results you plan/hope to obtain.

Page limit: Midway report should be 4-5 pages (5 pages maximum).
Grading scheme for the project report:
• 70% for proposed method (should be almost ﬁnished) and experiments done so far
• 25% for the design of upcoming experiments
• 5% for the plan of activities (in an appendix, please show the old plan and the revised one,

along with the activities of each group member)

Project Presentation (Date: Nov 27-Dec 4th Class Time)

All project members should be present. The session will be open to everybody.

Project Final Report (Date: Dec 5th)

Project Suggestions

Here are some project ideas and datasets for this year:

kaggle.com
NBA statistics data
Click here to download the dataset: contains 2004-2005 NBA and ABA stats for:

• Player regular season stats
• Player regular season career totals
• Player playoff stats
• Player playoff career totals
• Player allstar game stats
• Team regular season stats
• Complete draft history
• coaches season.txt: nba coaching records by season
• coaches career.txt: nba career coaching records
• Currently all of the regular season

Project idea: * outlier detection on the players; ﬁnd out who are the outstanding players. *

predict the game outcome.

Netﬂix Prize Dataset
The Netﬂix Prize data set gives 100 million records of the form ”user X rated movie Y a 4.0 on
2/12/05”. The data is available: here Netﬂix Prize and KDD-2007.

Project idea:

1. Can you predict the rating a user will give on a movie from the movies that user has rated in

the past, as well as the ratings similar users have given similar movies?

2. Can you discover clusters of similar movies or users?

3. Can you predict which users rated which movies in 2006? In other words, your task is
to predict the probability that each pair was rated in 2006. Note that the actual rating is
irrelevant, and we just want whether the movie was rated by that user sometime in 2006.
The date in 2006 when the rating was given is also irrelevant. The test data can be found at
this website.

Enron E-mail Dataset
The Enron E-mail data set contains about 500,000 e-mails from about 150 users.

The data set is available here
Project ideas: * Can you classify the text of an e-mail message to decide who sent it?

Precipitation data
This dataset has includes 45 years of daily precipitation data from the Northwest of the US:

Download Dataset:
Project ideas: Weather prediction: Learn a probabilistic model to predict rain levels. Sensor

selection: Where should you place the sensor to best predict rain?

Image Segmentation Dataset
The goal is to segment images in a meaningful way. Berkeley collected three hundred images and
paid students to hand-segment each one (usually each image has multiple hand-segmentations).
Two hundred of these images are training images, and the remaining 100 are test images. The
dataset includes code for reading the images and ground-truth labels, computing the benchmark
scores, and some other utility functions. It also includes code for a segmentation example. This
dataset is new and the problem is unsolved, so there is a chance that you could come up with the
leading algorithm for your project.

WebKB
This dataset contains webpages from 4 universities, labeled with whether they are professor, stu-
dent, project, or other pages.

Project ideas: * Learning classiﬁers to predict the type of webpage from the text. * Can you
improve accuracy by exploiting correlations between pages that point to each other using graphical
models?

Email Annotation
The datasets provided below are sets of emails. The goal is to identify which parts of the email refer
to a person name. This task is an example of the general problem area of Information Extraction.

Download Dataset
Project Ideas: * Model the task as a Sequential Labeling problem, where each email is a se-
quence of tokens, and each token can have either a label of ”person-name” or ”not-a-person-name”.

Object Recognition
The Caltech 256 dataset contains images of 256 object categories taken at varying orientations,
varying lighting conditions, and with different backgrounds.

Download Dataset
Project ideas: * You can try to create an object recognition system which can identify which ob-
ject category is the best match for a given test image. * Apply clustering to learn object categories
without supervision.
