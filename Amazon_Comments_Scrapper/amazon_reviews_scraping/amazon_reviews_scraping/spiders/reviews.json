My goal was to find a pitcher that can filter out the added fluoride in addition to heavy metals from old pipes, chlorine, and various other toxin chemicals. I live in Salt Lake City, and our city water is  very heavy and needs a decent filter system to be drinkable.\nMy research results can back with the Waterdrop only 2nd to the brand Clearly Filtered. The Clearly Filtered brand starts at $90 and the lab results between the two were close enough that the Waterdrop pitcher is the best option.\nPros:\n-Filters fast, it takes less than a minute to filter a full reservoir.\n-The water tastes great! The chlorine and metal taste is completely gone\n-Does not filter important minerals for good hydration\nCons:\n-The wood handle is unfinished, so it may need to be sanded at a later point from collecting dirt and grime. I recommend oiling the handle before using, but not a big deal"},

Supposedly each filter does 200 gallons of water, which was another reason I was interested in this filter.\nAfter a few months, the indicator light on the lid started blinking continually. I contacted the seller and within a few days I had a new lid. They replied to my email right away, so very good customer service."},

I purchased another water pitcher from a different brand a couple of months ago. It looks similar with the wood handle, but the other holds less and does very little to remove chlorine flavor.

This removed every bit of the residual chlorine taste. It also filters quite fast for the amount of contaminants it is removing. The top has an opening so you can run water into it without taking off the lid. That is a nice feature for those of us that like simplicity.

I will update this rating later if it is just the initial installation of every new filter but yes, I have a couple black particles that are a little hard to see, and some teeny tiny white beads as well that reminds me of styrofoam. It\u2019s a little hard to see in the photos and video but I was able to grab one to show yall. Is it normal and safe? The white stuff is so tiny that if I do not look carefully and if it actually gets through the filter to the supposedly clean filtered portion to drink, me or my family member might accidentally drink it and probably wouldn\u2019t notice it. That would be concerning and scary to drink. I didn\u2019t see any in the clean portion so far but I\u2019m not sure that will be consistent throughout the refilling until it\u2019s time for a new filter. It tastes fine and good.

IT'S NOT!\nwhile this filter does add SOME solids... whatever they may be (upon asking the company, they cant confirm to me what or at what levels/%'s theyre adding to my water. thats just not good enough for me as that info is important for optimal health.\nmy h2o is going from 176ppm (tap) to 6 (RO filter) to 26 (after a run thru the chubby alk). i WAS impressed. BUT, after chatting/reading others, the overall consensus was that 20ish ppm bump was virtually useless. barely anything being added back to my stripped water (came to find out that remineralizing/alkaline pitchers are considered a bit of a 'joke' in the industry). they simply dont do enough. so its just not worth it for my sitch since THAT is literally the only reason i bought the rig.\nso... just bought trace mineral drops. i add 20 of em to my 1/2gal mason jars of RO h2o. not such a pain afterall! TDS is up to 220-250ppm!! even higher TDS than my untreated tap water! but this is all GOOD trace minerals. & I 100% trust the mineral content (i requested a test results chart showing everything found) & the source/company. all works out to a little less than $10/month. for REAL results? i can do that. as far as Waterdrop's laughable increase of 20ppm? oh I cant go for that... no can do.\nso i changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars (woulda been 1 but they get credit for the beautiful pitcher design & the fact that it might be more beneficial for people who will settle for 'PUR' type filtration).\nsorry chubbs. ill miss ya but i cant use ya! youre going back."},

Those levels are low in my area and I'm not sure where I'm at on the fluoride debate anyway. That is the only thing holding me back from a 5-star review! I love how it looks, the way it functions, and more. It filters water fast and holds more than my previous pitcher."},

I've never used one of these before. I purchased it because I wanted to rid the city water in my home of fluoride and other harmful chemicals. I can't say that I've really noticed a difference in the taste but hopefully it's working. I wanted to write this review because I saw a lot of negative reviews about the red light coming on and staying on within a few days or way less than 90 days. The red light in my pitcher started flashing exactly 50 days from the time I activated it. I called the customer service number in the back of the owner's manual just to see if they could offer any explanations since it's supposed to last for 90 days. The lady I spoke with was very nice and informative. She said that anytime the red light starts flashing before the 90 days is up that it's definitely a malfunction but that the FILTER is fine and that it will continue to properly filter for the full 90 days. Unfortunately, I had already taken the filter out and replaced it with a new one. She said that the filter I removed would dry up quickly and wouldn't be any good so there wasn't any way to get the remaining 40 days out of it. Even if I had immediately put it back into the pitcher, the new filter would have dried out so either way I was out of a filter. She said she would send a new pitcher lid and water filter (to replace the one I had damaged by removing) which I received within a few days. Also, I want to add that if your red light starts blinking and it won't turn off, just hold it in for about 3 seconds and it should reset. If and when the water starts to filter slowly, all you have to do is take the filter out and shake it firmly against your hand about 10 times and it will start to filter more quickly. I've done that a few times and it makes a huge difference. If you have any problems with the pitcher or filters, I HIGHLY recommend giving them a call to see if they can help you out in any way."},

In Texas our water is severely polluted from decades of pollution & contamination from oil companies.  It's not safe for you or your animals to drink Tap water.  Ask your vet if you don't believe us.\nThe 200 gallon filters are one of it's biggest selling points. Both Brita and PUR require very frequent changes. Note we drink water 90% of the time.  This product is much more cost efficient.\nWe like the way the filter runs the whole width of the water jug; not just a corner. If you remove the lid to add water, put faucet in middle. This way each side of filter works.\nIf you are in a hurry ( and who isn't these days?). You can use a recyclable straw to prop the little window on the top. Then pour water to purify with a measuring cup or something with a spout.\nWater tasted the cleanest, purest in a glass\nMetal cups can add a tiny taste and plastics retain odors.  Took us a little to get used to taste. It's different. I would say pUR filtered water tastes better.  Put when faucet was replaced, PUR no longer fit.  The Water drop pitcher wins 4/5 categories.\nThe wood handle is very strong and easy to grasp. Pitcher does get heavy when full. Do not add water past the filter.  Happy Drinking"},

She had been buying bottled water for a long time, but I wanted to see if a filtered picture would address the problem. I can report this does solve that problem.\nI wanted something that would be easy for her to use, and not require frequent filter changes. This definitely fits the bill. I was impressed enough with it that I decided to purchase one myself, despite already having one of another brand. I've since had to purchase a ZeroWater pitcher for use with my humidifier (because I needed a product to filter dissolved solids), but when using it I sorely miss the design of the Waterdrop Chubby.\nSimply being able to place it under the faucet and fill through the flap, rather than pulling off and replacing a lid is how every pitcher should work in my opinion. The Chubby also comes with a little device that apparently counts the number of openings, and uses that to flash an alert when it is time to change the filter. As such, it should be much more accurate than simply changing a filter based on time alone.\nThe filter in the Chubby is essentially a dual filter, with two small streams emitted into the reservoir. As such, it fills much faster than other pitchers that emit only a single small stream.\nIt also pours quickly and easily, something that definitely wasn't the case with my first filter picture.  My ZeroWater pitcher also does well on that front, but is still bested by the Chubby.\nThe wood handle seems sturdy and feels good in the hand. I like the no-nonsense straight side design, as opposed to the tapered bottom one will find on many other pictures. A strictly rectangular design might be more efficient in terms of water volume for the footprint occupied, but that would also be more difficult to clean.\nThe only possible fault I've seen is one that seems to be shared with all pitchers (and certainly the three I've had experience with): The cover for the spout. All of them seem to be the same \"I'm going to break some day\" design. The plastic of the spout cover on the Chubby's seems to be a bit softer, so I doubt it will literally break, but it already has loosened enough on one side that it usually tilts to one side when open. I don't consider that a big issue, as it still stays out of the way of the stream, and goes back into place when pushed down."},

I keep a dispenser on the counter and a pitcher in my refrigerator, and the filters usually last me two months because of the quantity of water we use. Tap water where I live is chlorinated (you can taste it!), and the Waterdrop filters make our water taste great. The top of the pitcher is secure, unlike my previous Pur pitcher that fell off and cracked when I poured water. The Waterdrop Pitcher a little bit wider than I expected, and the wood handle looks great, but also makes the pitcher a bit heavier than the Pur.

If you use this system and your water has a strong component of chlorine, I recommend using two of them. I know it's costly, but poor health is even more costly, so there is that..."},

The pitcher is also durable and easy to use, which is always a plus.

The wood handle is lovely and easy to hold, but unfinished so will maybe get grimey and I'll have to sand it and/or oil it.  The top hatch that opens with pressure from the water is great so you don't have to remove a lid or anything -- they should all have this - but I wish it were a bit more sensitive so that I didn't get any pooling of water on top of the lid.  The water tastes great and I really like how quickly it filters, much faster than my previous Brita.  I'm small so I can't lift the full pitcher with one hand so I wish this pretty design came in a smaller size but it's really great.  Looks great on my counter.\nUpdate: it does dribble a bit when it's all the way full, and the lid wants to fall off when you're pouring the last drop when it's empty.  The water flap takes a second to open when you run the faucet into it which is just enough time for water to spill all over the lid.  Also, it's just big enough that little old me can't lift it when full with one arm.  Easy solutions: I never fill it all the way full, I always use two hands, hold the lid on when pouring the last bit and wipe it down with a kitchen cloth to dry it off every time I fill it.  If they made one that is just as pretty but a little bit smaller, with a water flap that's a little more sensitive and a lid that stays in place even at the last-drop angle, I would happily buy it."},

This is great. It looks good, not too big and works great. Its a little weird when you pour the water out but there's a certain way you have to hold the pitcher and it makes it easy.\nThe water filters pretty quick. The only thing I don't care for is when you fill it up with water, the water splashes a little because it hits a trap door looking thig first then it starts to go in. Its cool and all but it gets water all over the top of the pitcher. The cool thing about the trap door is it closes on its own when the reservoir is getting full to let you know to stop filling it up. Over all this is the best one i've found for a good price. I plan on getting one more for my fridge at work. the filters are also good for like 3 months which makes it nice"},

I had purchased 3 other pitchers from three other companies. However, they all seemed to use the same covers with the barely seen(as it was too light) notification on when to change filter and the tops don\u2019t  fit tightly and fall off!!!! This one, however, has a totally different cover with a little LED type of light (small circle on top toward the back) that will light up when filter needs changing after the initial set up. The wooden handle feels more sturdy. There is a hole with a clear cover on the top. When you turn on the water to fill, it opens  with the force of the water and closes immediately when you remove the pitcher from the fill. Genius!  You can remove the top, obviously, when you want to change the filter or clean. With the other companies, I concur with the other complaints, that it was impossible to get feedback from the companies.\nFollow up review:  I have been using this Alkaline Pitcher for over a year.  I had a problem taking the housing out to clean the bottom. Emailed the company and they returned the email within 24 hours!  I couldn't accomplish what they suggested, as my housing holding the filter would not come out to clean. The result?\nThey sent me a brand new pitcher!  How is that for excellent customer service!  Very rare these days!"},

No leaks on handle seams, or unfiltered water mixing with filtered while pouring a glass. Filtered water never connects with unfiltered, completely kept separate. Nicer container and filter storage. Filters more chemicals out of the tap water than britta does. Also filter drips clean water faster and last 1 month longer than the standard britta filter.  My only draw back to this container is,  they should rethink the container cap. When it's near empty, the cap falls off if tilted to high. You have to hold it in place to drain the pitcher. Otherwise I'd still buy again."},

Quite frankly, it's work. But these people, and this product, are absolutely the BEST I've ever come across.  Quick run down... The water filtration system is unparalleled.  I've had many systems.. Brita, Clear-Q, Aqua1, etc...  This thing literary pulls every microbe and piece of sludge from your tap. When you change the filter, you can literally feel the weight of all the heavy metals and PCB's it removes.  The water it filters tastes like it's from a mountain stream, and it's texture is like silk.  And when my LED sensor (filter timer) went dead after more than a year of heavy use, and WaterDrop was out of stock on that specific replacement part... they replaced the whole pitcher for free!!!  Didn't even pay for shipping.  I absolutely love this product, and their service.  I'm telling you right now... buy it.  Be healthy.  Be happy.  The water you drink should be as clean as the air that you breathe. Trust me.  \"DROP\" everything you're doing, and taste the good life!!!"},

Buying WaterDrop pitcher was the best decision I've made in this trying time of COVID-19.\nInitially, I had a little trouble because I saw no way to separate the inner *shelf* which suspends the filter from the outer pitcher. I just wanted to clean it before use. The customer service was very polite and helpful in responding to my dumb question. There are 4 small notches at the top that secure the filter holder to the pitcher but the plastic is so clear that I didn't see them, lol!  All I had to do was to slightly *pinch* the inner one to release.\nThe pitcher works very well, so quick, so easy and efficient. I experience no difficulty in refilling or pouring the last drop. The digital counter even works fine. I wish it were bigger like a gallon size but I guess many people keep it in the fridge, so good size for that. I like the extremely clear plastic material it's made of, the fact the filter doesn't sit in water, and more importantly it prevents/reduces limescale for my coffee maker. And I don't have to rely on the water dispensers that aren't maintained properly or regularly by somebody else other than me. Best of all, I don't have to go out for refills. The only caveat is that the replacement filters are currently unavailable on Amazon(and the price of the filters has gone up but so did many many other things due to the pandemic). If it really lasts 90 days or 200 gallons, it'd be 4 times cheaper than refilling at the dispensers, so I'd be content with even 50 gallons per filter."},

Our old water pitcher was slower, the lid was always falling off if we tilted it too much and if you filled it, but all of the water had not filtered through yet - it would come out the top when you tilted the pitcher too far.  This one does not do any of those things.  It filters fairly fast and water tastes great.  We also love the way you fill this pitcher, by not removing the lid, but by simply aiming the water at the fill hole/flap on the top.  If you just filled it with fresh water, but it had not all filtered through to the bottom yet - you still have no issues in going ahead and pouring the filtered water and using it, without having the unfiltered water you just put in spill out or pop off the lid."},

A water pitcher with a design that is practical and makes sense! FINALLY a pitcher that has a lid that does not fall off easily when I pour! FINALLY a handle that feels sturdy and doesn't feel like it can barely handle the weight when full. I LOVE the design. I also appreciate that the filter doesn't have to sit in the water (something that I have never understood). The solid wooden handle makes it look pricier. I have no idea if this thing only looks good. But hey I had no proof that the others did as advertised either. This one filters a lot faster. I don't know it that is a plus or a minus. I just got it and haven't drunk a drop yet! But I already like it much better than the ones that I have paid a lot more for. I sure hope that it lives up to the others and lives up to the design."},
