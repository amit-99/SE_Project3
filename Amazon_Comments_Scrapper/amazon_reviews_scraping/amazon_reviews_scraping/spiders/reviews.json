It also has an extra panel in the middle, for extra space on the scene, although the back and front sides are not as useable for sticker scenes as the other ones.  The main reason this is not my favorite of them all, is that the stickers are too hard to remove from the scene and reposition.  I nearly ripped the sticker trying to get it off the scene.  Also, the detail is a bit too fine, as the tails and legs are very thin, and I can see little kids ripping them off pretty easily. If they would get just a little less cut out, and leave a little more of the material around the edges, and a little easier to remove, this set would be a clear winner.  As is, I think with a lot of careful adult supervision, a 4-7 year old would have a lot of fun with this."},

Nice idea but when you get stuff online you never know how it looks like in reality. I scrolled the pictures- saw two kids near glass doors and thought that these stickers are nice and big. However, when I got the package I was disappointed- a lot of tiniest stickers that can easily be swallowed and lost. Nothing even close to what it was presented like! So before you buy these, reconsider."},

Having a sticker book to peel and restick again and again gives us mamas a moment back in their day. My son is vehicles obsessed so this set was perfect with all different kinds of vehicles to talk about and name. Even introduced some new ones to him like submarines and blimps!\nOf course once the stickers got really dirty they were unable to stick anymore. But extremely fun while it lasted!"},
