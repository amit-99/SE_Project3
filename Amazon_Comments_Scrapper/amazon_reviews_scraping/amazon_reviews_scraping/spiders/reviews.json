Fantastic! These are light and comfortable. Also glasses friendly since the ear pads are smaller.\nMany have asked online how these compare to the JBL710BT, but I haven't found any clear opinions. I have the JBL710BT and the JBL510BT, and I took the time to compare the feel and sound of these.\nThe mids and highs of the 510 and 710 are very similar and hard to tell apart. The biggest difference is the bass. Despite the smaller drivers, the 510 has enhanced bass and a higher max volume. Usually this is great and works well with \"normal\" balanced music. Songs with heavy bass, sometimes it is a little too much.\nThe 510 is wireless only. The 710 also has a cable, if you want/need to connect this way -- and it sounds just as good without power.\nThe 710 is a bit larger and heavier. The larger ear pads block out more ambient noise than the smaller 510.\nBoth models are great BT headphones. They are as good as other name brands.\nI recommend the 510 because of the light weight and higher max volume.\n-Chris"},

My AirPods gave out after a couple of years and I wanted to try over the head studio headphones. I talked myself down from spending 100s of dollars on beats and gave these a try. These are perfect to me! I wear headphones all the time while cleaning, while working, even for my sounds while I sleep occasionally. I go to the gym maybe 4 times a week and I use headphones then as well. These headphones have checked all of those boxes flawlessly. They aren\u2019t tight on my head like other reviews have stated and the pad around the ears makes them very comfortable. They also don\u2019t slip and slide all over the place. A pretty nice fit! But that battery life though!! I charge these when I remember, which is maybe once a week. After using them sun up to sun down they have never died on me. I was also skeptical about the color because I didn\u2019t want them to stain but the color seems to be holding up well. I lay these things anywhere and they haven\u2019t tarnished as far as I can see. There is a clicking noise that is pretty faint. I only hear it when I have them on and nothing is playing. To me, that is a drop in the bucket and nothing to fret about because these are pretty darn good headphones. They aren\u2019t just good for the price these are good PERIOD! This is a great buy! Oh and the sound quality which is a pretty important aspect to mention is fantastic. I would say it definitely rivals my AirPods. Especially watching a movie or tv show, the sound quality immerses you like a surround sound theater."},

Wanted them as a more comfortable alternative to my beats earbuds, and these do the job. The unit has good sound quality and is easy to use, but some of the build features seem destined to fail.\nFirst, the swivel on the individual cans is dependent on a very narrow plastic, presumably hollow (how else would the wires be run?) pin. Care should be taken not to over-rotate the cans and stress/fatigue the pin. The other thing I wasn\u2019t crazy about is the material (pleather?) used on the padding. It feels EXTREMELY thin and I anticipate it tearing quite easily. I worry abt transport or even adjusting while wearing.\nPerformance is good, esp\u2019ly when considering the value. All of the controls (Vol & pairing) are intuitive even while wearing/using once one familiarizes themselves with their placement. They\u2019re on the R can, so just be aware if you\u2019re a lefty. Definitely more function than form - the design of the unit is quite plain, which suits me just fine.\nAside from babying the unit to avoid tearing the padding material or breaking the swivel on the cans, I anticipate being happy with these."},

And not being tech savvy at all, straight out of the box I got them connected, super simple plug and play! Volume control fast forward to the next song taking calls etc work seamlessly..Thank God for that lol\nAnd they have a comfortable fit on your head and ears at least for me..\nYou really can't go wrong with JBL, they make a great product and for this price it's a great buy. Get yourself a pair while this price lasts. You won't be disappointed I guarantee it."},

Let me tell y'all - the way it made my music sound puts other headphones to SHAME.\nI've only had these a few weeks, but they were easy to set up and easy to operate. I gave it 5 Stars for Noise Cancellation even though they didn't claim to be, and here's why: The on-ear design naturally cancels out ALL noise!\nI live in NYC and, honestly, in order to be aware of my surroundings while on the subway, I HAVE to pull the headphones slightly off my ear - or I won't hear ANYTHING outside of my music!  I don't know how long the battery lasts because - quite frankly - the battery has NEVER run out on me (and I've had it running for 3 hours at one point!).\nThe ONLY thing that makes me mad about this headset is that I purchased it when it was nearly 50% off and FAILED to get another set before it went back to its' original price of $50. Still, even at THAT price point, this headset is DEFINITELY worth every penny.\nI HIGHLY recommend it!"},

They didn\u2019t take long to charge at all and are still at 100% charge. I have a small head and ears so the shortest setting the head band can go is perfect for me, the headphone part is smaller than most headphones but for me is a perfect size, will not slip off my head. The audio quality is far superior than AirPods, the bass is amazing. I have the audio up load and when wearing no one can hear your music unless they\u2019re right up to your face. Noise canceling is good I can barely hear anything around me with the music on. The middle button to accept an incoming call works great! I can hear the other person on the line just fine, Bluetooth was super easy to connect as well. Over all super satisfied with these especially for the price, I highly advise getting them if you\u2019re looking for great headphones for the gym, working on the computer, working outside or whatever! And love the pink color if you want to pink ones, they\u2019re definitely a soft pink but super cute"},

I wanted a headset that was durable, comfortable, reliable, easy to adjust to different head sizes, would partly block sounds in his shared room, and was relatively inexpensive in case it got lost. These headphones met all those requirements and I can highly recommend them for listening to streaming videos.\nMy only reservation is that the sound quality is not good enough for music. I used them on a long plane flight and found the sound quality to be fair to poor with a wide range of recordings with which I\u2019m familiar. I\u2019m a bit of an audiophile and these headphones were relatively inexpensive, so I wasn\u2019t surprised and you shouldn\u2019t hold that too much against them. They are durable, reliable, comfortable - and have really long battery life."},

I've had the Charge 3 for a while now and it's just awesome. I used to have skullcandy headphones and would never part with them, until they broke anyway. I found these on sale and figured I'd try them, I already have the portable, why not headphones? I'm super pleased with these headphones. They look fly, connected to my phone in a flash, and the sound is comparable to my old skullcandys. They sit nicely on my ears so they're pretty comfortable to wear too. They charged really fast as I used them most of the evening after they got to me. A case would be nice as I'm paranoid of getting these dirty. Overall you can't go wrong with this set of headphones. They sound great, comfortable to wear, easy to use, and look amazing too!"},

If you're in the market for headphones, these are no-brainers at 50% off. Sound is excellent and can be tweaked through an equalizer app and battery life is fantastic. The one constant negative I've read is that the headband is too small. Well, I have a big head (no jokes please) and found the fit comfortable enough. The earpad don't enclose the ear but fit snugly against the ears without pressing too tight. In fact, I've found them comfortable enough that I sleep in them. I live in a very noisy environment and am a light sleeper to boot. Shutting out outside sounds is critical to being able to fall asleep for any length of time. I've used the headbands with speakers, but the headphones are better at blocking out sound, and pairing them  with a YouTube submarine engine sound video effectively blocks out the outside world and puts me deep under the sea. I sleep like a baby since I've gotten these. For $25 bucks, you're not going to get better sound."}
