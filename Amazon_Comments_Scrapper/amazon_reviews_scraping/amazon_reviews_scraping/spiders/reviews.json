They are exactly as described and look exactly like the pictures. They were packaged well and fit my face well. They do not, however, cover your peripheral vision since they are very straight and square. They look great on, though! There is a very slight yellow tint to them, but it is hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it--this is one of the reasons I chose these instead of other, much yellower glasses.\nBefore buying, I read another review that said they get streaky when you try to clean them. This is true, but there's an easy fix. I've just run them under water, used my fingers to rub in a bit of baby (or other gentle) soap on both sides of the lenses, then used a special microfiber lens cleaning cloth to dry them. The cloth makes all the difference and got the previous streaks right off!\nThese are my first computer glasses, so I don't know how other pairs are, but the only annoying thing is that there is some glare in the corners of them when I am sitting in front of my screen. I'll be interested to see if they help my eye strain/sleep cycle over the coming weeks and will update this review if needed. But I recommend purchasing these to anyone on the fence!"},
