It\u2019s sturdy, easy to assemble and lightweight. It doesnt feel cheap and the wood looks and feels nice. When assembling just make sure the holes are pointed at the right direction tho as we got it wrong and had to start all over again. Otherwise we\u2019re very happy with it as it wasn\u2019t super expensive and the dimensions are decent."},

I needed a side table for my work from home setup.  This has really fit the bill.  I am especially pleased with how sturdy it is.  Usually, tables in this price range end up being wobbly.  Not this one.  This is very sturdy and I highly recommend it."},

It took about 30 minutes to set up & instructions were very clear. I was a bit disappointed about the buffed damage towards the bottom of the desk however it's not noticeable so it's not a big deal. Rated it 4 stars because of the slight damage but overall a nice & sturdy desk.\ud83d\udc4d"},
