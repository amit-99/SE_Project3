year of the COVID-19 pandemic, global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25%, according to a scientific brief released by the World Health Organization (WHO) today.\nGaps in

updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030, which includes an indicator on preparedness for mental health and psychosocial support in public health emergencies.\nWHO\u2019s most recent Mental Health Atlas showed that in 2020, governments worldwide spent on average just over 2% of their health budgets on mental health and many low-income countries reported having fewer than 1 mental

be sick for a longer period.\nPeople can be immunocompromised either because of a medical condition or because they receive immunosuppressive medications or treatments.\nIf you or someone you live or spend time with is immunocompromised, it is important to have a COVID-19 plan to protect yourself and others from infection.\nSince your immune response to COVID-19 vaccination may not be as strong as in people who are not immunocompromised, you may have different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.\nLearn more about COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for people who are moderately or severely
